# minigames

## Context:
Although I am primarily more focused on Data Science and Machine Learning, I still believe that a strong understanding of computer science and algorithms is very important. To practice, I will be creating minigames here and try to implement algorithms into my games as well. This repository is a work in progress.

## Goal:
* To practice my computer science skills and to strengthen my knowledge of algorithms by creating small computer games that can be played on the console/terminal

## Currents Games:
* TicTacToe 
  * Human vs Human
  * AI (with Minimax) vs Human
